# Robustly Typed

> Robustness is the property of being strong and healthy in
> constitution. When it is transposed into a system, it refers to the
> ability of tolerating perturbations that might affect the system's
> functional body. In the same line robustness can be defined as "the
> ability of a system to resist change without adapting its initial
> stable configuration".
